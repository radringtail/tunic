                    <b>Ledge Clip</b>: To the right of the Atoll save is a broken stairway leading to a fallen ladder. If approached at the right angle, <span class="text-warning">the fox can clip off of the ledge</span> and fall down next to the ladder, skipping the slower route around the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a small lip, hidden from the camera, behind the broken column near the save. If the fox runs directly at this and down the stairs, holding direction, it will walk over the edge and fall down to the sand.

                    Note: This is only faster if you get it the first few times, but saves significant time if done on the first try. Beginners can skip this.

                    As soon as you land, approach the nearby fallen ladder and interact with it to raise it. You can quit and continue as soon as the animation starts.

                    If you are learning / practicing, you can run to the hidden chest under the bird-guarded chest (down the stairs into the water and around) for two extra ice bombs. This helps while learning Basketbomb and is a nice marathon strat for consistency.

                Run down to the ladder and <a href="#" data-bs-toggle="modal" data-bs-target="#ladderStorage">Ladder Storage</a> off the top. Run toward the NE fuse hill and run up the ramps to elevate. When you start up the 3rd ramp, <span class="text-warning">exit so you have just enough height to clear the brick catwalk</span> and run into the Frog's Domain cave. Descend into Frog's Domain, cutting the corners the best you can.
