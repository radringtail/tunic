                Descend one ladder, grapple the sniper to the right to a small ledge, then descend the one-way ladder and fall to the ground. Once you hit the ground, quickly swap to <span class="badge text-bg-light">Orange Peril Ring</span>.

            You can instead menu to Sword instead of Orb at the shortcut and not grapple the sniper to the south. When you fall and switch to Orange Peril Ring, he will shoot at you. It's fairly easy to dodge and save a couple seconds, but it's risky.
