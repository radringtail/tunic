            Bomb out of the mandatory cutscene on first death

        <p>
            "Resurrection" is a mandatory cutscene that plays on your save's first death.
            It is long and unskippable with menuing or quitting out, and you cannot open
            the menu during this scene.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, your inventory upon entering is still active. 
            As long as you have a bomb equipped on your first
            death, you can use it here to death warp out of the scene.
